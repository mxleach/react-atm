# ATM Machine with React 

## Description:
For Week 15 of MIT xPro's full-stack development course, we created a React-based front-end ATM app. We are given starting code and tasked with refactoring the app and making improvements. 

## Improvements
- Added validation to ensure the user cannot withdraw more money than the account balance. 
- Modified UI to require user to select an option before the input field appears. 
- Implemented simple styling to build a more user-friendly UI. 
- Added .ToLocaleString() to optimize readability (adds commas to value when necessary).
- Dropdown menu instead of buttons to select user action (Deposit or Withdraw). 

## How to Run
To run this application locally, simply: 
1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into project directory.
3. Run `index.html` on local server.
